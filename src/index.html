                I wanted everything—very earnestly and totally—I wanted to have every experience I could have, I wanted
                everything that was possible to a person in a female body
              </q>

                Feminist Beat poet Diane di Prima was born in Brooklyn, New York.
                She attended Swarthmore College for two years before moving to
                Greenwich Village in Manhattan and becoming a writer in the emerging
                Beat movement. There, she developed friendships with poets Amiri
                Baraka, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Frank O’Hara, and Audre Lorde.
                After joining Timothy Leary’s intentional community in upstate New
                York, she moved to San Francisco in 1968.
              </p>
              <p>
                Di Prima’s poetry mixes stream-of-consciousness with attention to
                form and joins politics to spiritual practice. In an interview with
                Jacket magazine, di Prima spoke about her life as a writer, a
                mother, and an activist.

              How many late nights did we haunt the Store<br>
              buying scads of new poems from all corners of the earth<br>
              then head to the all-night Tower Records full of drag queens<br>
              & revolutionaries, to get a few songs<br>
              And dig it, City Lights still here, like some old lighthouse<br>
              though all the rest is gone,<br>
              the poetry’s moved upstairs, the publishing office<br>
              right there now too & crowds of people<br>
              one third my age or less still haunt the stacks<br>
              seeking out voices from all quarters<br>
              of the globe

                The author of more than 40 collections of poetry and poetics, Anne Waldman is an active member of the
                Outrider
                experimental poetry movement, and has been connected to the Beat movement and the second generation of
                the New York School.
              </p>
              <p>
                Her work as a cultural activist and her practice of Tibetan Buddhism are deeply connected to her poetry.
                Waldman is, in her words, “drawn to the magical efficacies of language as a political act.” Her
                commitment
                to
                poetry extends beyond her own work to her support of alternative poetry communities. Waldman has
                collaborated
                extensively with visual artists, musicians, and dancers, and she regularly performs internationally. Her
                performance of her work is engaging and physical, often including chant or song, and has been widely
                recorded
                on film and video.
